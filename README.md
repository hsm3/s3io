# S3io

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fiksu/s3io.png)](https://travis-ci.org/fiksu/s3io)

An IO-compatible wrapper for S3.

Amazon's official AWS SDK provides an API for S3 that isn't compatible with Ruby's standard IO class and its derivatives. This gem provides a thin wrapper around AWS SDK that makes it possible to access objects stored on S3 as if they were instances of File or StringIO classes.

Currently only reads are supported with writes support coming soon.

## Warning

Reads currently don't guarantee consistency if S3 file changes while being streamed. I plan to solve this, but meanwhile please keep in mind that you may read garbage if you replace S3 file while streaming it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 's3io'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install s3io

## Usage

Once wrapped, S3 objects behave the way you'd expect from an ordinary IO object.
It can read:

    require 'aws-sdk'
    require 's3io'

    s3_object = S3.buckets['some-bucket'].objects['path/to/object']
    io = S3io.open(s3_object, 'r')

    first_100_bytes = io.read(100) # reading first 100 bytes

    io.rewind # back to the first byte

    io.lines do |line|
      puts line # Just printing lines one by one
    end

    io.pos = 42 # seek byte 42

    puts io.read # and print everything from that byte to the end


It can write:

    require 'aws-sdk'
    require 's3io'

    s3_object = S3.buckets['some-bucket'].objects['path/to/object']

    S3io.open(s3_object, 'w') do |s3io|
      io.write 'abc'
      io.write 'def'
    end

## To do

* Code documentation
* Fix an issue where S3 file that is updated while read streaming happens may result in garbage being read
